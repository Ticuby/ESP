## Algorithm1_KNN
After placing the Messidor dataset in the `images` folder, run `knn-pupil_recognition.py` to perform image classification. If you want to categorize `messidor_features` directly into two categories, run `knn-视网膜特征分类.py`

## Algorithm2_Bayes
After placing the Messidor dataset in the `images` folder, run any `.py` file to perform image classification. 

## Algorithm3_SVM
After placing the Messidor dataset in the `images` folder, run `SVC.py` to perform image classification.

## Algorithm4_VIT
After placing the Messidor dataset in the `images` folder, run `视网膜病变.py` to perform image classification. Within this algorithm you need pre-training files.

## Algorithm5_ResNet
After placing the Messidor dataset in the `images` folder, run `train_imagenet_cpu.py` to perform image classification, and You can modify the network used in the code. Within this algorithm you need pre-training files.
